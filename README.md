A file splitting algorithm I made for fun.
I didn't put too much thought into it.
Use it to split a file into 2 files that by themselves have no meaning.
This has the potential to be ultra secure with the dramatic downfall of requiring twice the storage space as the single unsplit file.
Since this algorithm affects every byte of a file by splitting it randomly it should in theory be as secure as the most secure file.
By using this software you agree that I am not responsible for any data loss you may experience.
Have fun. :)
